## 📓 Devlog

### **Dec 24, 2025**

#### 🧩 Feature Summary
- Today I started creating my first game (ever!). I initialized the Godot project and set up this GitHub repository to log all my progress in making this game.
- I set up the first character.
- Added left-to-right movement, jumping, and gravity.
- Created a simple idle animation for the character.

---

#### ⚠️ Challenges
- Perhaps the most challenging tasks today were making the character and its corresponding idle animation.
- I am not much of an artistic guy, but I am willing to improve.
- I went on Pinterest and found some good references to use for making the character, specifically this one by xxx.
- Overall, I am happy with how the animation and character turned out, even if it took me several hours to complete.
